# RRTree
A program for relative-rate tests
<hr>
RRTree is **no longer maintained**, as better methods for the study of evolutionary rates now exist. You might want to check for more recent methods [here](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html#Stratigraphy), and especially the [PAML package](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html).

We will keep the source code and documentation available here, as a service to those who wish still to use RRTree, for any reason.

<hr>
If you have problems using RRTree, you can contact me here, but I rarely have time to investigate bugs.
