# RRTree
A program for relative-rate tests
<hr>
RRTree is <strong>no longer maintained</strong>, as better methods for the study of evolutionary rates now exist. You might want to check for more recent methods <a href="https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html#Stratigraphy">here</a>, and especially the <a href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html">PAML package</a>.

We will keep the source code and documentation available here, as a service to those who wish still to use RRTree, for any reason.

If you have problems using RRTree, you can contact me here, but I rarely have time to investigate bugs.
