                               RRTree

                    a program for relative-rate tests

                            version 1.1



The program RRTree compares substitution rates between DNA or protein
sequences grouped or not in phylogenetically defined lineages. The methods
involved are mostly described in:

Robinson M, Gouy M, Gautier C, Mouchiroud D (1998) "Sensitivity of the relative
-rate test to taxonomic sampling", Mol Biol Evol 15(9):1091-1098.

The reference for the software itself is:

Marc Robinson-Rechavi and Dorothée Huchon (2000) "RRTree: Relative-Rate Tests between groups of sequences on a phylogenetic tree", Bioinformatics 16(3): 296-297.


The source file, this documentation, and example files may be freely downloaded
from:

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/rrtree.html
ftp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/pub/mol_phylogeny/rrtree/

To use this program, just compile it with any standard C compiler available.
There is only one source file, no extra ".h" or makefile. On unix, the command
to compile the program will generally be something like:

cc -o RRTree -O RRTree.c -lm

Compiled versions for PC (RRTree.exe and RRTree_PC.zip) and Macintosh
(RRTree_Mac.sea.hqx) are also available. For Macintosh users, see remarks at the
end of this file.


** Entry files

RRTree uses 3 entry files, one compulsory and two optional:

- a file of all aligned sequences. Order of sequences is not important.
The following formats are implemented: MASE, CLUSTAL, GDE, FASTA, PHYLIP,
NEXUS, MEGA, LINTREE and PHYLTEST. There may be bugs in the implementation of 
PHYLIP and NEXUS, as these are complex formats I do not use commonly. So don't
be afraid to report any bugs!

- an optional command file, which allows defining in advance the user options
which will then be used by the program. This is especially practical when
similar computations have to be done, in peculiar to avoid re-entering lineage
affectation of sequences (see below).


- an optional NEWICK/PHYLIP file containing a guide tree.

The program can be run without any guide tree, in which case the option not to
take topology into account should be chosen. Please note that RRTree does not
construct a tree, it must be provided.

You will find example files of all formats at the FTP site. Please let me know
if you favourite format is missing.

There are no compulsory rules on the file names, even though the program suggests
default names.


** Options and choices

There are many questions asked to the user, most of which have a default
answer between brackets [ ]. This answer will be accepted by simply pressing
the enter/return key, and I hope is generally not a bad choice. Answers to
questions may also be recorded in a command file; this is explained further on.


The most important choice is that affecting sequences to lineages. You may
define as many lineages as you choose (no more than sequences!). The program
will then present you with each sequence name, and ask you to affect it to any
lineage, including outgroup (defined by zero, not by the capital "o"). You can
also exclude sequences from the analysis (defined by -1).

In the following example, three lineages were defined, primates, rodents
and ungulates, birds being the outgroup, and the carnivore excluded:

> For each sequence, give its lineage number (1 to 3), or 0 for the outgroup
> lineage, or -1 to exclude a sequence from the computation:
> Human: 1
> Mouse: 2
> Sheep: 3
> Pig: 3
> Mink: -1
> Guinea_pig: 2
> Horse: 3
> Chicken: 0

	These lineages may also be defined in the command file (see further on).

	If you define more than 2 lineages, all pairwise comparisons will be
done: 1-2, 1-3 and 2-3 for 3 lineages. Do not abuse of this option, as
repetition of tests makes your tests less and less reliable! A good rule of
thumb is dividing the risk threshold by the number of tests. In the example of 3
tests, don't use a 5% threshold but a 5/3=1.7% threshold.

	You can also give the lineages labels of your choice, for example
"murids" and "primates", or "parasitic" and "nonparasitic", etc.


** Trees

	Branches of the guide tree supported by less than a given support score
(bootstrap or whatever kind of numerical parameter choosed by the user) can be
considered as unresolved, resulting in additional polytomies. Branches of length
zero are always considered as unresolved. Polytomies can also be noted by
absence of branches. Thus the following examples are three possible notations of
the same tree, with a polytomy between mouse, guinea pig and human (assuming a
score limit of 50):

(Chicken,(Human,((Sheep,Pig),Horse,Mink),Mouse,Guinea_pig));
(Chicken,((Human,((Sheep,Pig)80,(Horse,Mink)45)95)45,(Mouse,Guinea_pig)45)100);
(Chicken:0.4,((Human:0.2,((Sheep:0.05,Pig:0.05):0.05,(Horse:0.1,Mink:0.1):0.0):0.1):0.0,(Mouse:0.2,Guinea_pig:0.2):0.0):0.2);


                          ***  IMPORTANT  ***

The branch separating outgroups from ingroups must not be considered unresolved
(length 0 or support under threshold), and the outgroup must be monophyletic
relative to the ingroups

As RRTree does not have a graphical interface, I recomand PC and Mac users copy
your entry files into the same folder as the application.

** Distances computed

On coding sequences, RRTree computes synonymous and non synonymous rates according
to the method of Li (1993) and Pamilo and Bianchi (1993). The parameters computed
are:

- Ks	number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site.
- As	number of synonymous transitions per synonymous site.
- B4	number of synonymous transversions per fourfold degenerate site.
- Ka	number of non synonymous substitutions per non synonymous site.
- Ba	number of non synonymous transversions per non synonymous site.

The default is to compute Ks and Ka, which sum all the information. The other
parameters are computed in case of problems with these two parameters, and I
advise against computing all parameters in all cases, as you again will have
a problem of test repetition, plus one of non independence between these tests.

- As is usefull when Ks is very small. There may be more information on rate
differences using transitions alone than all synonymous substitutions in that
case, because they are the fastest.
- B4 is usefull when Ks is saturated because of saturation of transitions. It's
the opposite case from above, you may find information in the generally slower
transversions.
- Ba may be usefull when Ka is saturated, although I personnally never
encountered the case!

More important in my opinion, both B4 and Ba are very usefull when there
is a GC-content difference between compared sequences, which will bias Ks and Ka
estimates (Saccone et al. 1989). In such a case, transversions escape the bias
(Galtier and Gouy 1995), so they should be prefered. The problem is that B4 may
be computed on not so many sites, so beware of its high variance.


On non coding sequences, RRTree computes the 1-parameter distance of
Jukes-Cantor (1969), or the 2-parameter distance of Kimura (1980), which
distinguishes between transitions and transversions.


On proteic sequences, RRTree computes a simple adaptation of the Jukes-Cantor method.


In all cases, covariances are computed as in Li and Bousquet (1992),
that is by calculating the sum of variances of relevant internal branches, and
not as in Takezaki, Rzhetsky and Nei (1995), who use the direct estimation
method of Bulmer (1991). If you wish to use that method, the program of Takezaki
et al. is freely available at:

http://www.bio.psu.edu/faculty/nei/imeg/


** Command file:

It may contain as many empty lines as you wish, and any line starting with "#"
will be ignored as remarks. All other lines must contain an identifier, followed
by a column ":", followed by the value. The identifiers recognized are:

"aligned" -> name of the input file of aligned sequences.
"format" -> file format (MASE, PHYLIP, FASTA, ...).
"length" -> only for PHYLIP files, the length of sequence names.
"lineages" (with a final "s") -> number of defined lineages.
"outgroup" -> name of the outgroup lineage.
"lineage" followed by a number ("lineage1", "lineage2", ...) -> name of the
specified lineage.
"type" -> sequence type .Possible values: "cds" (coding sequence), "nc" (non
coding), or "prot" (protein).
"code" -> genetic code. Possible values: "nucl" (nuclear) or "mito" (vertebrate
mitochondrial code).
"topology" -> 1/0 choice to use topological weigths.
"tree" -> name of the input tree file.
"threshold" -> value under which nodes are considered unresolved. If specified
as 0, no threshold used.
"text" -> output text file. If specified as 0, output on screen.
"table" -> output table file. If specified as 0, no such file.
"ks", "ka", "ba", "b4", "as" -> 1/0 choice to use these distance measures or
not. Will only be read if the input file is coding sequences (cds).
"distance" -> distance measure used on non coding DNA sequences (nc). Possible
values: "jc" (Jukes-Cantor 1 parameter) or "k2" (Kimura 2 parameters).

And most important, any sequence name may be followed by its lineage
attribution. For example:
HOMO_GH: 1
means that sequence "HOMO_GH" is in lineage 1.

Although you can create manually a command file, it is easiest to run a
first time RRTree with manual input of option values, asking the program to
create a command file. You will then be able to use this file to re-run the same
commands, and especially modify it (through any text editor, "save as text") in
order to do further runs with little differences.

You can download an example file called "exple.com".


** Output

RRTree has 2 outputs:

- a compulsory text output intended for human readers, which may appear on
the screen or be written to a file. It includes all available information,
including the exact probability.

- an optional output file which contains numerical results in a table form,
and which I hope to be practical for systematic treatment of the results,
through Excel or any other software.


The test is significant at a given level (say 5%) if P is smaller than that
level (say 0.05). In other words:
- P=0.9 is highly non significant, the two lineages evolve at the same rate.
- P=0.0001 is highly significant, one lineage evolves much faster than the
other.


I do not believe that there is anything tricky in the options or computations
involved, but please contact me otherwise.


** For unix or MS-DOS users:

You may specify the comand file after the executable name:

prompt% RRTree file.com

There used to be a possibility of automatically using all default options, this
has been replaced by use of the command file.

It is recomanded for PC usesr to always save the output in a file, as the
MSDOS window does not allow reading more than the last page printed on the
screen.


** For Macintosh users:

A compiled version for Macintosh is also available through FTP. It is Binhexed
and Stuffed. Most FTP softwares (including Netscape) should uncompress it
automatically, providing you with the source, the documentation and example
files, and the application, but in case of problem please contact me. It should
work all Macintoshes.


** Error messages:

RRTree gives error messages when incompatibilities are found between the data
expected and input, or in case of computation problems. The most common
error messages are:

- When coding sequences do not contain a number of nucleotides divisable by
three. Coding sequences are expected to always be in phase 1, and not contain
any frame-shits. 
- When data are saturated. When divergence between sequences is too great, it
can become impossible to compute distances.
- When the outgroup is not monophyletic relative to the ingroups.

All source codes are yours to use and modify freely as long as it's not for
commercial purposes, and that I'm credited.
